### HTTP Cats

Initially I would like to talk about this amazing API which was the main purpose of our chatbot, which is the [HTTP Cats](https://http.cat/)!!

Basically, this API returns an image in the JPEG format with the "feline representation" of the HTTP status code. That's why I love the internet.

### python-telegram-bot

This library provides a pure Python interface for the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api). It's compatible with Python versions 2.7, 3.3+ and [PyPy](http://pypy.org/). It also works with [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine).

In addition to the pure API implementation, this library features a number of high-level classes to make the development of bots easy and straightforward. These classes are contained in the `telegram.ext` submodule.
